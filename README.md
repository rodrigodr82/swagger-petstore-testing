What is Jest
    Jest is a Javascript testing framework developed by Facebook. It is a JavaScript library for creating, running and writing tests.

    There are many types of tests, and you will soon be overwhelmed by the terminology, but the long story short tests fall into three categories:
        *  unit test
        *  Integration Testing
        *  E2E test

Explanation: I decided use this tool because at this time many apps are created in JavaScript and Jest is JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase. It allows you to write tests with an approachable, familiar and feature-rich API that gives you results quickly.

Execution by terminal
    npm test   // to run all test cases
    npm test test_name.test.js  // to run specific test case only

Note: I was not able to setup swagger locally but I am using the same swagger that is available by web.
